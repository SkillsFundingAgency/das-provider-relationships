This folder should not be here. It's another nasty hack (like the 'feature toggle' UseGovUkSignIn). Once this codebase has been upgraded to .net6+ then this folder and all contents can be deleted and equivalent functionality (at time of writing) gained by use of the SFA.DAS.OidcMiddleware.GovUk nuget package instead.

Also, when the time comes to remove this folder please also remove the config `SFA.DAS.ProviderRelationships.Configuration.GovUkOidcConfiguration` which is in a different project to avoid a circular reference.
