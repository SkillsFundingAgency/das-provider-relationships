Possible Improvements

switch web project to .net core

package up layout and/or layout functionality

package up authentication
	we could simplify the identity config by
		replace all the endpoints in the config with a single entry to an OIDC matadata endpoint which supplies the endpoints (better, more work, see https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1)
		have a single config containing the endpoints shared between all relying parties, rather than duplicating it in each websites config
	we might be able to optimise the authentication flow by using Hybrid, rather than code and get the tokens at the same time as the code

security: app service full access to db

full sign-out between subsites:
    // the current sign-out solution will only sign-out the user from the current sub-site and mya
    // a solution to sign out of every sub-site, would be to have 2 sign out endpoints per site
    // InitialiseSignOut & SignOut
    // InitialiseSignOut would redirect to SignOut of first subsite in list
    // SignOut for subsite would sign out that subsite (if currently signed in)
    // then call Signout of next sub-site in list
    // last in list would be MYA, which would do it's current signout
    // e.g. list A -> B -> C -> MYA
    // user signed into B & MYA, selects signout from B
    // sequence...
    // B.InitialiseSignOut -> redirect A.Signout
    // A Signout not signed in, just redirect B.Signout
    // B.Signout signed in so sign out, redirect C.Signout
    // C.Signout not signed in, just redirect MYA.Signout
    // MYA.Signout signout as normal
alternatively:
	* can we access cookies of parent domain to delete them? can the tld store cookies in subdomain? can we delegate all cookie deleted to ma (can tld create subdomain cookies)
