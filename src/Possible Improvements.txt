Possible Improvements

switch web project to .net core

package up layout and/or layout functionality

package up authentication

Do we need to re-add claims in PostAuthenticationAction (are they required at all)? if so, if we need mapping, could JwtSecurityTokenHandler.InboundClaimTypeMap do the job?

security: app service full access to db

full sign-out between subsites:
    // the current sign-out solution will only sign-out the user from the current sub-site and mya
    // a solution to sign out of every sub-site, would be to have 2 sign out endpoints per site
    // InitialiseSignOut & SignOut
    // InitialiseSignOut would redirect to SignOut of first subsite in list
    // SignOut for subsite would sign out that subsite (if currently signed in)
    // then call Signout of next sub-site in list
    // last in list would be MYA, which would do it's current signout
    // e.g. list A -> B -> C -> MYA
    // user signed into B & MYA, selects signout from B
    // sequence...
    // B.InitialiseSignOut -> redirect A.Signout
    // A Signout not signed in, just redirect B.Signout
    // B.Signout signed in so sign out, redirect C.Signout
    // C.Signout not signed in, just redirect MYA.Signout
    // MYA.Signout signout as normal
alternatively:
	* can we access cookies of parent domain to delete them? can the tld store cookies in subdomain? can we delegate all cookie deleted to ma (can tld create subdomain cookies)
